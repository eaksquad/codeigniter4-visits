## Quick Start

1. Run: `> composer require tatter/alerts`
2. Load the helper: `helper("tatter\alerts");`
2. Set an alert: `alert('success', "You did it!")`
3. Add in head tag (optional): `<?= alertsCss(); ?>`
4. Add after banner/menu: `<?= alerts(); ?>`

## Features

Provides out-of-the-box user alerts for CodeIgniter 4

## Installation

Install easily via Composer to take advantage of CodeIgniter 4's autoloading capabilities
and always be up-to-date:
`> composer require tatter/alerts`

Or, install manually by downloading the source files and copying them into CodeIgniter 4's
app/ same subdirectories.

## Configuration (optional)

The library's default behavior can be overridden or augment by its config file. Copy
src/Config/Alerts.php.example to app/Config/Alerts.php and follow the instructions in the
comments. If no config file is found the library will use its defaults.

## Usage

If installed correctly CodeIgniter 4 will detect and autoload the library, helper, and
(optional) config. Initialize the helper before using its functions:
`helper("tatter\alerts");`

Then use the helper function `alert($class, $text)` to set an alert for the user's next
view. Use helper functions `alertCss()` and `alerts()` to retrieve the styling and HTML
for the alerts.

## Styles

By default alerts will be displayed with classes for Bootstrap. Styles can be changed
to other toolkits (or may use your own) by altering the settings in the config file.
